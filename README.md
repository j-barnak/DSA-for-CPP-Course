# Welcome to the DSA Course for C++

This is a curated course for C++ and its aim is to create strong C++ programmers using a hands-on project oriented approach.

We will be using: 
* Modern CMake
* Creating containers as per the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container">named containers requirements</a>
    * This means creating generalized data structures and algorithms
* GTest to ensure correctness within our code
