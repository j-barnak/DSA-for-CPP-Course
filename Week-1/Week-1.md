# Week 1

This week we will be introducing some core concepts within C++ that will enable us to create efficient data structures and
algorithms. In addition, we'll dive into the basics of analysis of algorithms. 

Topics to be Covered:
* Asymptotic Notation
* Lambda Functions and Higher Order Functions
* Smart Pointers
* Templates
* Move Semantics
* Iterators

## Assignments
### Asymptotic Notation
Read:
* Chapter 3 of Algorithms Illuminated, Part 1

Watch: 
* Section 1.X of Abdul Adari's Algorithm Playlist found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IAPZzGSbME&list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O&index=1"> here </a>

Exercises:
* <a href="https://brilliant.org/practice/big-o-notation/">These</a> practice problems on Brilliant's site.
    * The code is in Python, but can be easily understood
* <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/asymptotic-notation">These</a> problems found on Khan Academy's Algorithm course
    * There's no need to read the sections as what you have read/watched should be more than sufficient
